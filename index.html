    <p>Data Engineering student who currently has her sights set on a part-time data science internship. Passionate about using knowledge to solve real-life problems, I am, as Hilary Mason would put it, an ‘awesome nerd’. Not only do I have the technical skills to code and organize information and data in programs and languages such as Excel, VBA, Python, SQL, Access, and Oracle, but I am also capable in leveraging my communication skills that help me explain the impact of my work to others. </p>
    <p>
        I have an insatiable curiosity and do best in a team setting, working with others to explore and create innovative solutions with optimal, efficient, and clean results.
